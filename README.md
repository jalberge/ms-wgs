This repository contains code used to analyze data reported in the Alberge, Dutta, Poletti, et al. paper. 

## Data availability

Most data from the PCROWD study reported as average are available to other researchers upon request to Dr Ghobrial (mailto: Irene_Ghobrial [at] DFCI[dot]HARVARD[dot]EDU). Sequencing data will be made available shortly on the dbGAP study phsxxxx [New Stury Registered].
